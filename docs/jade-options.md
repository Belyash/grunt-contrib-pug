# Options

## files
Type: `Object`

This defines what files this task will process and should contain key:value pairs.

The key (destination) should be an unique filepath (supports [grunt.template](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/docs/api_template.md)) and the value (source) should be a filepath or an array of filepaths (supports [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch)).

Note: When the value contains an array of multiple filepaths, the contents are concatenated in the order passed.

## options.data
Type: `Object`

Sets the data passed to `jade` during template compilation. Any data can be passed to the template (including `grunt` templates).
